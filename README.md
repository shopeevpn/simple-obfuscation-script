# simple-obfuscation-script

Certainly! Here's a simple obfuscation script that replaces all alphanumeric characters in a Bash script with random characters:

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g. obfuscate.sh) and make it executable by running:

```
chmod +x obfuscate.sh
```

Then, run the script and provide your original Bash script as the input file:

```
./obfuscate.sh your_script_name.sh > obfuscated_script_name.sh
```

This will generate an obfuscated version of your Bash script named obfuscated_script_name.sh. You can then use this obfuscated script in place of your original script.

Note that this obfuscation script is a simple example and does not provide any significant security. Someone with sufficient knowledge and skill could still potentially reverse-engineer and decipher the obfuscated script. Additionally, obfuscating your script may make it more difficult to maintain and debug, so use this technique with caution.
